# Hard-Level Python Problems on Loops & Conditionals (No Strings or Non-Primitives)*

# ---

# #### 🔁 Loops + Conditional Challenges

# 1. *Armstrong Number Check*
#    Without using string or list, check if a number is an Armstrong number (e.g., 153 → $1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153$).

# 2. *Prime Digit Count*
#    Count how many digits in a number are prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Do this without converting to string or using arrays.

# 3. *Number Pyramid with Arithmetic Pattern*
#    Print a triangle of numbers like:

   
#    1  
#    2 3  
#    4 5 6  
#    7 8 9 10  
   
#   up to n rows using loops only.

# 4. *Print all prime numbers in a range without using any collections or strings.*

# 5. *Find GCD and LCM of two integers using only loops and conditionals.*

# 6. *Digit Alternation Check*
#    Check whether the digits of a number alternate between even and odd (e.g., 2727 → yes, 2468 → no).

# 7. *Binary to Decimal Converter (Without using bin(), int(), or strings)*
#    Take input as an integer containing only 0s and 1s (e.g., 1011) and convert it to decimal using math.

# 8. *Decimal to Binary Converter (Without using bin(), format(), or strings)*
#    Convert a decimal number into binary and display it as an integer.

# 9. *Kaprekar Number Check*
#    A number is Kaprekar if the square of the number can be split into two parts which add up to the original number.
# 10. *Find the N-th Prime Number*
#     Using loops and conditions only, find the N-th prime number.

# ---

# #### 🔀 Advanced Conditionals + Loops

# 11. *Custom Pattern*
#     Print the following without using any non-primitives:

    
#     1  
#     0 1  
#     1 0 1  
#     0 1 0 1  
    

#     (alternate pattern based on row number and position)

# 12. *Check if number is Happy Number*
#     (Repeatedly replace number with sum of squares of digits; if it becomes 1, it’s happy).

# 13. *Check if a number is Harshad (Niven) Number*
#     A number is divisible by the sum of its digits.

# 14. *Number Reduction Game*
#     Start with a number n, apply these rules until n == 1:

#     * If even: divide by 2
#     * If odd: multiply by 3 and add 1
#       Count steps needed to reach 1.

# 15. *Find all numbers between 1 and 1000 where sum of digits equals the product of digits.*

# 16. *Magic Number*
#     A number is magic if repeatedly summing its digits reduces it to 1. (e.g., 1729 → 1+7+2+9 = 19 → 1+9 = 10 → 1+0 = 1)

# 17. *Reverse a number and check if both original and reversed are prime.*

# 18. *Check if digits of a number are in strictly increasing or decreasing order.*

# 19. *Create a square pattern of numbers increasing row-wise (no arrays or strings).*
#     Example (n = 3):

#     1 2 3  
#     4 5 6  
#     7 8 9
    

# 20. *Find smallest number greater than N such that the number and its reverse are both divisible by 7.*
